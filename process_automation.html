            <!-- <h3>Role</h3> -->
            <p>During my time at Deloitte I had the privledge of desiging, architecting and developing multiple web applications. The downside of growing my skills in this space is that I can’t share many details, so aplogies in advance for the low fidelity of the applications and the vague nature of the description of the utility of each. In this case study I will be outlining my role in designing and developing a process automation application.</p>

            <!-- <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>The goal of our research was to discover people's current processes/decision-making about career aspirations and the role of a mentor in their individual journeys, we wanted insight on how they feel about the overall experience of recruitment and what the mentees found valuable for that process.</p> -->

            <!-- <h3>Ecosystem Map</h3>
            <p>The Ecosystem Map was incorporated to understand what value was being transferred between the stakeholders. This activity helped draw insight into what questions were critical to focus on moving into the development of the Interview Guide.</p>

            <figure>
              <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
                  <p>"There’s a big difference between making a simple product & making a product simple."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <figcaption>—Traynor, <cite>Co-Founder of Intercom</cite></figcaption>
            </figure>


            <p>Insights from Ecosystem Map:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>CC isn't adding much unique value to mentors or mentees.</li>
              <li>Creating materials (IP) is a way CC could add more unique value.</li>
              <li>The meaningful value exchange is between mentee and mentor.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>Through these insights we began creating our interview guide. We created the interview guide to ensure the questions asked were specific enough to draw relevant information, but broad enough to gain a wide variety of perspectives. We also chose to begin broad and hone into more organization specific questions, as exemplified below.</p>

            <p>Sample Questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Was there a job that you always wanted to be when you were little?</li>
              <li>What do you need to get there?</li>
              <li>How much does making good professional connections play into this?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once the interview guide was completed we moved into the user interviews. I acted as the interview lead and navigated through the prepared interview questions during our User Interviews. Each interview was held for 30 minutes and each was recorded in case transcripts weren’t fully captured. My role after the interviews were conducted, was to pull out data points and organize them into an excel doc to prepare for the Affinity Diagramming stage. For this step we brought in all the data points and brought them onto a miro board to begin the process. We separated out the data on three separate occasions to account for oversights in the separation process. Once the data was separated we assigned themes to the different clusters of data points and once each theme was organized into columns we moved into developing insights.</p>

            <h3>Outputs</h3>
            <p>A final deliverable presentation was created to share with the functional team within the organization. The presentation showcased the insights that were discovered during the research process and opened the floor to a brainstorming session to see what procedural or applicational changes needed to be made.</p>
            <p>After the brainstorming session the organization took on a new approach in their current marketing strategy to be better tailored for the types of users that were singing up for the application. Another result was the focus around intellectual property and the organizations focus on creating more materials to share with future mentees.</p> -->
